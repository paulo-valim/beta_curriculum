## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Create the Perfect AI

You're going to create the perfect AI for rock paper scissors that will always win.

```mermaid

scissors --beats--> paper --beats--> rock --beats--> scissors
```

The player will enter a `player_choice` of `:rock`, `:paper`, or `:scissors`. Then the AI program will return the answwer that beats the player choice.

So if the player chooses `:rock`, the program should return `:paper`.

Given a `player_choice` of either `:rock`, `:paper`, or `:scissors` determining the winning
`ai_choice`.

  <summary>Hint</summary>

  Remember you can conditionally return values using boolean operators.
  For example, you can use this to return `:paper` if the `player_choice` is `:rock`.

  ```elixir
  player_choice = :rock

  player_choice == :rock && :paper
  ```

  Alternatively you can use `if` statements.

  ```elixir
  if player_choice == :rock, do: :paper
  ```

  You can use this in combination with re-binding the variable to
  return the winning choice.

  ```elixir
  player_choice = :scissors
  ai_choice = if player_choice == :rock, do: :paper
  ai_choice = if player_choice == :paper, do: :scissors, else: ai_choice
  if player_choice == :scissors, do: :rock, else: ai_choice
  ```

  Or you could chain a series of conditions without re-binding `player_choice`.

  ```elixir
  player_choice = :scissors
(player_choice == :rock && :paper) || (player_choice == :paper && :scissors) ||
  (player_choice == :scissors && :rock)
  ```

  There are also cleaner solutions using language features we have not yet covered
  such as the `case` statement.

  ```elixir
  player_choice = :scissors
  
  case player_choice do
    :rock -> :paper
    :paper -> :scissors
    :scissors -> :rock
  end
  ```
</details>

Enter your solution below.

```elixir
player_choice = Enum.random([:rock, :paper, :scissors])
IO.puts("Player choice is #{player_choice}")

cond do
  player_choice == :rock -> IO.puts("AI choses paper, you lose!")
  player_choice == :paper -> IO.puts("AI choses scissors, you lose!")
  player_choice == :scissors -> IO.puts("AI choses rock, you lose!")
end
```

## Create Two Player Rock Paper Scissors

Now that you know how to create a rock paper scissors AI, you're going to create a two player game of rock paper scissors.

Given `player1` and `player2` select either `:rock`, `:paper`, or `:scissors`, return `"Player1"`, `"Player2"`, or `"Draw"`.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  
  We can use boolean operators and/or `if` statements to create a sequence of conditions to determine the winner message.

  ```elixir
  player1 = :rock
  player2 = :scissors

  player1_won = player1 == :rock and player2 == :scissors or player1 == :paper and player2 == :rock or player1 == :scissors and player2 == :paper
  draw = player1 == player2


  winner_message = if player1_won, do: "Player1", else: "Player2"
  winner_message = if draw, do: "Draw", else: winner_message
  ```

  There are cleaner solutions using language features we have not covered yet such as `case`.

  ```elixir
  player1 = :rock
  player2 = :scissors

  case {player1, player2} do
    {:rock, :scissors} -> "Player1"
    {:paper, :rock} -> "Player1"
    {:scissors, :paper} -> "Player1"
    {:rock, :paper} -> "Player2"
    {:paper, :scissors} -> "Player2"
    {:scissors, :rock} -> "Player2"
    {_same, _same} -> "Draw"
  end
  ```

  You can also reduce code repetition using functions, which we have also not yet covered.

  ```elixir
  player1 = :rock
  player2 = :scissors

  beats? = fn choice1, choice2 ->
    {choice1, choice2} in [{:rock, :scissors}, {:paper, :rock}, {:scissors, :paper}]
  end

  cond do
    beats?(player1, player2) -> "Player1"
    beats?(player2, player1) -> "Player2"
    player1 == player2 -> "Draw"
  end
  ```

</details>

Enter your solution below.

```elixir
player1 = Enum.random([:rock, :paper, :scissors])
player2 = Enum.random([:rock, :paper, :scissors])

IO.puts("Player1 chose #{player1}")
IO.puts("Player2 chose #{player2}")

cond do
  player1 == :rock && player2 == :rock -> "Draw"
  player1 == :rock && player2 == :paper -> "Player2"
  player1 == :rock && player2 == :scissors -> "Player1"
  player1 == :paper && player2 == :rock -> "Player1"
  player1 == :paper && player2 == :paper -> "Draw"
  player1 == :paper && player2 == :scissors -> "Player2"
  player1 == :scissors && player2 == :rock -> "Player2"
  player1 == :scissors && player2 == :paper -> "Player1"
  player1 == :scissors && player2 == :scissors -> "Draw"
end
```

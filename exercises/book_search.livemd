## Book Search

You are building an application for searching books.

Represent each book as a `Book` struct with `title` and `content` keys. Then create a `Book.search/2` function to filter a list of Book structs as documented in the `Book` module below.

```elixir
defmodule Book do
  defstruct [:title, :content]

  @moduledoc """
  Documentation for `Book`.

  ## Examples

    iex> %Book{title: "My Book Title"}
    %Book{title: "My Book Title"}
  """

  @doc """
  Search a list of Book structs. Search should match any book that includes the
  filter in their title.

  ## Examples

  Include books that exactly match the search query.

    iex> book1 = %Book{title: "A"}
    iex> book2 = %Book{title: "B"}
    iex> book3 = %Book{title: "C"}
    iex> Book.search([book1, book2, book3], "A")
    [%Book{title: "A"}]

  Include books that partially match the search query.

    iex> Book.search([%Book{title: "ABC"}], "A")
    [%Book{title: "ABC"}]

    iex> Book.search([%Book{title: "BAC"}], "A")
    [%Book{title: "BAC"}]

  Search should be case insensitive.

    iex> Book.search([%Book{title: "ABC"}], "a")
    [%Book{title: "ABC"}]
  """
  def search(books, query) do
    for books <- books, query == query do
    end
  end
end
```

```elixir
book1 = %Book{title: "A", content: "content1"}
book2 = %Book{title: "def", content: "content2"}
book3 = %Book{title: "GHI", content: "content3"}

Book.search([book1, book2, book3], "A")
```
